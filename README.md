Design, development and implementation of a relational database for SuperMaids Cleaning Company.

Case Study: SuperMaids Cleaning Company

  The SuperMaids Cleaning Company specializes in providing cleaning services for clients. Each type of client has a set of requirements. For example, The Cardboard Box Company requires cleaning services from Monday to Friday 7am until 9am and 5pm until 7pm each day, but P. Nuttall only requires cleaning services on a Wednesday from 10am until 1pm.
  
  Whenever a new client is taken on, it is determined whether any special equipment is required and when. For example, three industrial floor cleaners may be needed on two out of five occasions for one client. Therefore, the following information will be stored for each equipment, in addition to the equipment identifier: description, usage and cost.
  
  For each employee, the following data will be stored: staff number (uniquely identifies an employee), first and last name, address, salary and telephone number. For each client, the following data will be stored: client number (uniquely identifies a client), first and last name, address and telephone number.
